## 1. Your words are power.

> A robed wizard standing at the edge of a vast dark void, lips parted mid-utterance, a single glowing word floating before them in luminous gold script. The word unfurls outward into branching constellations, circuits, and living systems that stretch to the horizon. The wizard's expression is one of awe and gravity.

## 2. Own your consequences.

> A wizard kneeling in the smoldering ruins of a spell gone wrong — cracked stone, scattered embers, a shattered mirror reflecting their own face. They do not flee; they press one hand to the ground, accepting the weight of what they have done. A single intact candle burns beside them.

## 3. Do not lust for power.

> A wizard standing at a crossroads. One path leads toward a towering throne wreathed in dark storm clouds and crackling lightning. The other leads toward a humble village with warm lamplight in the windows. The wizard turns their back on the throne, walking toward the light.

## 4. Practice safe magic.

> A wizard inside a glowing circular ward — a protective circle of runes etched into stone — carefully testing a volatile spell contained within a glass orb. Outside the circle, the world is dark and uncertain. Inside, the wizard works with calm focus.

## 5. Do not fight your wand.

> A wizard and their wand in a moment of harmony — the wand glowing softly, the wizard's hand relaxed and open, not gripping. Streams of light flow naturally between hand and wand like water finding its course. Nearby, a discarded wand lies cracked on the floor, evidence of a past struggle.

## 6. Protect the restricted section.

> A grand library with towering shelves of ancient tomes. One section is sealed behind iron bars and glowing wards, its books pulsing with dangerous energy. A wise elder wizard stands guard, gently but firmly turning away a young eager apprentice who reaches toward the locked gate.

## 7. Wish magic is risky.

> A wizard holding a glowing orb of pure wish-light, their face illuminated with hope — but behind them, their shadow on the wall shows the wish already spiraling out of control, growing monstrous and tangled. The contrast between the wizard's hopeful expression and the ominous shadow is stark.

## 8. Write and rewrite grimoires.

> A wizard's desk covered in open grimoires, some ancient and worn, some freshly inked. The wizard writes in one book while referencing another, adding new annotations to old spells. Quills, ink pots, and candles surround them. Through the window, other wizards can be seen doing the same in distant towers — a network of shared knowledge.

## 9. Respect your clients.

> A wizard sitting across a low table from a humble traveler, listening intently with hands folded. The traveler speaks, gesturing with quiet urgency. The wizard's staff leans against the wall — unused, patient. The wizard's magic glows softly in the background, ready but restrained, waiting to serve rather than to lead.

## 10. Speak to the trees.

> A young wizard sitting at the base of an enormous ancient tree, its bark carved with hundreds of runes and symbols — the accumulated scars of past spells. An elder spirit or face emerges from the bark, speaking. The young wizard listens with eyes closed, hands on the roots, absorbing centuries of hard-won wisdom.

## 11. Cast spells only after having vision.

> A wizard standing still at the center of a chaotic magical storm of their own making — half-cast spells swirling around them in confusion. They close their eyes, breathe, and in the stillness a single clear vision crystallizes before them: a luminous blueprint of what they truly intend to create. The storm begins to settle.
